# Usage Guide for PlayInsight Suite

This document explains how to run the PlayInsight Suite using Docker and Visual Studio Code Dev Containers.

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed on your system:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) with Ubuntu installed  
  - Recommended for Windows users who want to work in a Linux terminal  
  - Ensure you've installed Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store and set it as your default WSL distro
- VS Code Extensions:
  - Remote - Containers (aka Dev Containers)
  - Python
  - Docker

---

## 🧪 Getting Started with Dev Containers (Recommended)

### 1. Set Up a Local Projects Folder and Clone the Repository

Choose or create a local folder where you keep code projects.

**If using WSL:**

```bash
cd /mnt/c/projects     # or your preferred folder
git clone https://github.com/jshumway0475/Petroleum.git
cd Petroleum
```

**If using Git in Windows PowerShell or CMD:**

```powershell
cd C:\projects
git clone https://github.com/jshumway0475/Petroleum.git
cd Petroleum
```

### 2. Open the Folder in VS Code

In VS Code, go to File → Open Folder, and select the `Petroleum` directory you just cloned.

### 3. Reopen in Dev Container

You should be prompted to "Reopen in Container". Click Yes.

If not prompted, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and run:

```
Dev Containers: Reopen in Container
```

VS Code will now:

- Build the Docker image
- Mount your code into the container
- Create a local virtual environment at `.venv`
- Install the project in editable mode using:

```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir -e .
```

## 🐳 Running the Docker Image Without VS Code (Optional)

If you're not using VS Code, you can pull and run the image directly:

```bash
docker pull jshumway0475/playinsight-image:latest
```

Then run it:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace jshumway0475/playinsight-image python3
```

💡 If you're using PowerShell or CMD on Windows, replace `$(pwd)` with the full path to your project directory, like:

```powershell
-v C:/Users/yourname/projects/conduit:/workspace
```

This launches a clean, fully configured environment with all required dependencies pre-installed.

Note: The container uses a non-root user (`appuser`) with passwordless sudo access. You will not be prompted for a password when installing additional packages or running privileged commands inside the container.

## 🤔 Running the Workflow

Once inside the container (via VS Code or Docker):

1. **Edit the config**  
   Modify `config/analytics_config.yaml` with your database connection info and default parameters.

2. **Run workflows manually or on a schedule**  
   Example:

   ```bash
   python play_assessment_tools/arps_autofit.py
   ```

3. **Populate your database**  
   Use the scripts in the `sql/` folder to create tables, stored procedures, and views.

4. **Connect to Spotfire or another BI tool**  
   Use the SQL views created to visualize spacing, parent-child relationships, forecasts, etc.

## 🔄 Rebuilding the Container

If you change `requirements.txt` or `Dockerfile`, rebuild the container by running:

```
Ctrl+Shift+P → Dev Containers: Rebuild Container
```
